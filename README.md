# Abraham Mendez Portfolio

Website application portofolio to showcase my design skills using vanilla HTML and CSS.

The pictures inside the project are placeholders since I have only worked on 1 deployed project.

As I work on different projects and get better at css I will improve the design and update my portfolio.
